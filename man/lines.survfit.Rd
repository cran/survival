  Add Lines or Points to a Survival Plot 
}
\description{
Often used to add the expected survival curve(s) to a Kaplan-Meier plot 
generated with \code{plot.survfit}. 
}
\usage{
\method{lines}{survfit}(x, type="s", pch=3, col=1, lty=1,
        lwd=1, cex=1, mark.time=FALSE, xmax,
        fun, conf.int=FALSE,
        conf.times, conf.cap=.005, conf.offset=.012,
        conf.type = c("log", "log-log", "plain", "logit", "arcsin"),
        mark, noplot="(s0)", cumhaz= FALSE,  ...)
\method{lines}{survexp}(x, type="l", ...)
\method{points}{survfit}(x, fun, censor=FALSE, col=1, pch,
        noplot="(s0)", cumhaz=FALSE, ...)
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{
a survival object, generated from the \code{survfit} or \code{survexp} functions. 
}
\item{type}{
the line type, as described in \code{lines}.  The default is a step function 
for \code{survfit} objects, and a connected line for \code{survexp}
objects.
All other arguments for \code{lines.survexp} are identical to those
for \code{lines.survfit}.
}
\item{col, lty, lwd, cex}{
  vectors giving the mark symbol, color, line type, line width and
  character size for the added curves.  Of this set only color is
  applicable to \code{points}.
}
\item{pch}{plotting characters for points,  in the style of
  \code{matplot}, i.e., either a single string of characters of which
  the first will be used for the first curve, etc; or a vector
  of characters or integers, one element per curve.
}
\item{mark}{a historical alias for \code{pch}}
\item{censor}{should censoring times be displayed for the \code{points}
  function?
}  
  
\item{mark.time}{
controls the labeling of the curves.   
If \code{FALSE}, no labeling is done.   
If \code{TRUE}, then curves are marked at each censoring time.   
If \code{mark.time} is a numeric vector, then curves are marked at  
the specified time points. 
}
\item{xmax}{optional cutoff for the right hand of the curves.}
\item{fun}{
an arbitrary function defining a transformation of the survival curve. 
For example \code{fun=log} is an alternative way to draw a log-survival curve 
(but with the axis labeled with log(S) values). 
Four often used transformations can be specified with a character 
argument instead: "log" is the same as using the \code{log=T} option, 
"event" plots cumulative events (f(y) = 1-y), 
"cumhaz" plots the cumulative hazard function (f(y) = -log(y)) 
and "cloglog" creates a complimentary log-log survival plot  
(f(y) = log(-log(y))) along with log scale for the x-axis. 
}
\item{conf.int}{
if \code{TRUE}, confidence bands for the curves are also plotted. 
If set to \code{"only"}, then only the CI bands are plotted, and the curve 
itself is left off.   
This can be useful for fine control over the colors or line types of a
plot.
A numeric value, e.g. \code{conf.int = .90}, can be used to 
}
  \item{conf.times}{optional vector of times at which to place a
    confidence bar on the curve(s).  If present, these will be used
    instead of confidence bands.}
  \item{conf.cap}{width of the horizontal cap on top of the confidence
    bars; only used if conf.times is used.  A value of 1 is the width of
    the plot region.}
  \item{conf.offset}{the offset for confidence bars, when there are
    multiple curves on the plot.  A value of 1 is the width of the plot
    region. If this is a single number then each curve's bars are offset
    by this amount from the prior curve's bars, if it is a vector the values are
    used directly.}
  \item{conf.type}{
	One of \code{"plain"}, \code{"log"} (the default),
	\code{"log-log"}, \code{"logit"}, or \code{"none"}.  Only
	enough of the string to uniquely identify it is necessary.
	The first option causes confidence intervals not to be
	generated.  The second causes the standard intervals
	\code{curve +- k *se(curve)}, where k is determined from
	\code{conf.int}.  The log option calculates intervals based on the
	cumulative hazard or log(survival). The log-log option bases the
	intervals on the log hazard or log(-log(survival)), and the
	logit option on log(survival/(1-survival)). 
      }
  \item{noplot}{for multi-state models, curves with this label will not
    be plotted.  The default corresponds to an unspecified state.}
  \item{cumhaz}{plot the cumulative hazard, rather than the survival or
    probability in state.}
\item{...}{other graphical parameters}
}
\value{
a list with components \code{x} and \code{y}, containing the coordinates of the 
last point on each of the curves (but not of the confidence limits). 
This may be useful for labeling.

one or more curves are added to the current plot.

\details{
  When the \code{survfit} function creates a multi-state survival curve
  the resulting object has class `survfitms'.  The only difference in
  the plots is that that it defaults to a curve that goes from lower
  left to upper right (starting at 0), where survival curves default
  to starting at 1 and going down.  All other options are identical.

  If the user set an explicit range in an earlier \code{plot.survfit}
  call, e.g. via \code{xlim} or \code{xmax}, subsequent calls to
  this function remember the right hand cutoff. This memory can be
  erased by \code{options(plot.survfit) <- NULL}.
