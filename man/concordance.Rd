\title{Compute the concordance statistic for data or a model}
\description{
The concordance statistic compute the agreement between an observed
response and a predictor.  It is closely related to Kendall's tau-a and
tau-b, Goodman's gamma, and Somers' d, all of which can also be
calculated from the results of this function.

\arguments{
  \item{object}{a fitted model or a formula.  The formula should be of
  the form \code{y ~x}  or \code{y ~ x + strata(z)} with a single
  numeric or survival response and a single predictor.
  Counts of concordant, discordant and tied pairs 
  are computed separately per stratum, and then added.
}

 \item{data}{
    a data.frame in which to interpret the variables named in 
    the \code{formula}, or in the \code{subset} and the \code{weights}
    argument. Only applicable if \code{object} is a formula.
  }
  \item{weights}{
    optional vector of case weights.
    Only applicable if \code{object} is a formula.
  }
  \item{subset}{
    expression indicating which subset of the rows of data should be used in 
    the fit.   Only applicable if \code{object} is a formula.
  }
  \item{na.action}{
    a missing-data filter function.  This is applied to the model.frame
    after any subset argument has been used.  Default is
   \code{options()\$na.action}. Only applicable if \code{object} is a formula.
  }

  \item{\ldots}{multiple fitted models are allowed.  Only applicable if
    \code{object} is a model object.}
  
  \item{newdata}{optional, a new data frame in which to evaluate (but
    not refit) the models}
  
  \item{cluster}{optional grouping vector for calculating the robust
    variance}
  
  \item{ymin, ymax}{compute the concordance over the restricted range
     ymin <= y <= ymax.  (For survival data this is a time range.)
  }
  \item{timewt}{the weighting to be applied.  The overall statistic is a
      weighted mean over event times.
    }
  \item{influence}{1= return the dfbeta vector, 2= return the full
    influence matrix, 3 = return both
  }
  \item{ranks}{if TRUE, return a data frame containing the
    individual ranks that make up the overall score.  
  }
  \item{reverse}{if TRUE then assume that larger \code{x} values predict
    smaller response values \code{y}; a proportional hazards model is
    the common example of this. }

  \item{timefix}{if the response is a Surv object, correct for possible
    rounding error; otherwise this argument has no effect.  See the
    vignette on tied times for more explanation.  For the coxph and
    survreg methods this issue will have already been addressed in the
    parent routine, so should not be revisited.
  }
  \item{keepstrata}{either TRUE, FALSE, or an integer value.
    Computations are always done within stratum, then added. If the
    total number of strata greater than \code{keepstrata}, or
    \code{keepstrata=FALSE}, those subtotals are not kept in the output.
    }
}
\details{
  At each event time, compute the rank of the subject who had the
  event as compared to all others with a longer survival, where the
  rank is value between 0 and 1.  The concordance is a weighted mean
  of these values, determined by the \code{timewt} option.
  For uncensored data each unique response value is compared to all
  those which are larger.

  Using the default value for \code{timewt} gives the area
  under the receiver operating curve (AUC) for a binary response,
  and (d+1)/2 when y is continuous, where d is Somers' d.
  For a survival time, \code{timewt} of n gives Harrell's c-statistic,
  which is closely related to the Gehan-Wilcoxon test,
  S corresponds to the Peto-Wilcoxon, n/G2 is the weighted advocated
  by Umo, and S/G the weighting proposed by Schemper.

  When the number of strata is very large, such as in a conditional
  logistic regression for instance (\code{clogit} function), a much
  faster computation is available when the individual strata results
  are not retained.  In the more general case the \code{keepstrata = 10}
  default simply keeps the printout managable.
}
\value{

  An object of class \code{concordance} containing the following
  components:
  \item{concordance}{the estimated concordance value or values}
  \item{count}{a vector containing the number of concordant pairs,
     discordant, tied on x but not y, tied on y but not x, and tied on
     both x and y}
  \item{n}{the number of observations}
  \item{var}{a vector containing the estimated variance of the
    concordance based on the infinitesimal jackknife (IJ) method.
    If there are multiple models it contains the estimtated
    variance/covariance matrix.}
  \item{cvar}{a vector containing the estimated variance(s) of the
    concordance values, based on the variance formula for the associated
    score test from a proportional hazards model.  (This was the primary
    variance used in the \code{survConcordance} function.)}
   \item{dfbeta}{optional, the vector of leverage estimates for the
     concordance}
   \item{influence}{optional, the matrix of leverage values for each of
     the counts, one row per observation}
   \item{ranks}{optional, a data frame containing the Somers' d rank
     at each event time, along with the time weight, case weight of the
     observation with an event, and variance (contribution to the
     proportional hazards model information matrix).
     A weighted mean of the ranks equals Somer's d.}
