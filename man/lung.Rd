\note{
  The use of 1/2 for alive/dead instead of the usual 0/1 is a historical
  footnote.
  For data contained on punch cards, IBM 360 Fortran treated blank as a zero,
  which led to a policy within the section of Biostatistics to never
  use "0" as a data value since one could not distinguish it from a
  missing value.
  The policy became a habit, as is often the case; and the 1/2 coding
  endured long beyond the demise of punch cards and Fortran.
