  Compute a Survival Curve for Censored Data 
}
\description{
  Computes an estimate of a survival curve for censored data using
  the Aalen-Johansen estimator.  For ordinary (single event) survival
  this reduces to the Kaplan-Meier estimate.
}
\usage{
\method{survfit}{formula}(formula, data, weights, subset, na.action,  
        stype=1, ctype=1, id, cluster, robust, istate, timefix=TRUE,
        etype, model=FALSE, error, entry=FALSE, time0=FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{formula}{
    a formula object, which must have a 
    \code{Surv} object as the  
    response on the left of the \code{~} operator and, if desired, terms  
    separated by + operators on the right. 
    One of the terms may be a \code{strata} object.
    For a single survival curve the right hand side should be \code{~ 1}.
  }
  \item{data}{
    a data frame in which to interpret the variables named in the formula, 
    \code{subset} and \code{weights} arguments. 
  }
  \item{weights}{
    The weights must be nonnegative and it is strongly recommended that  
    they be strictly positive, since zero weights are ambiguous, compared 
    to use of the \code{subset} argument.
  }
  \item{subset}{
    expression saying that only a subset of the rows of the data 
    should be used in the fit. 
  }
  \item{na.action}{
    a missing-data filter function, applied to the model frame, after any 
    \code{subset} argument has been used. 
    Default is \code{options()$na.action}. 
  }
  \item{stype}{the method to be used estimation of the survival curve:
    1 = direct,  2 = exp(cumulative hazard). }
  \item{ctype}{the method to be used for estimation of the cumulative
    hazard: 1 = Nelson-Aalen formula, 2 = Fleming-Harrington correction
    for tied events.}

  \item{id}{
    identifies individual subjects, when a given person can have multiple
    lines of data.
  }
  \item{cluster}{used to group observations for the infinitesimal
    jackknife variance estimate, defaults to the value of id.}

  \item{robust}{logical, should the function compute a robust variance.
    For multi-state survival curves or interval censored data
    this is true by default.
    For single state data see details, below.}
 
  \item{istate}{for multi-state models, identifies the initial state of
    each subject or observation.  This also forces \code{time0 =TRUE}.}

  \item{timefix}{process times through the \code{aeqSurv} function to
  eliminate potential roundoff issues.}

  \item{etype}{
    a variable giving the type of event.  This has been superseded by
    multi-state Surv objects and is deprecated; see example below.
  }
  \item{model}{include a copy of the model frame in the output}
  \item{error}{this argument is no longer used}
  \item{entry}{if TRUE, the output will contain \code{n.enter} which is
    the number of observations entering the risk set at any time; extra
    rows of output are created, if needed, for each unique entry time.
    Only applicable if there is an \code{id} statement.
  }
  \item{time0}{if TRUE, the output will include estimates at the
    starting point of the curve or `time 0'.  See discussion below.
  }
  \item{\dots}{
    The following additional arguments are passed to internal functions
    called by \code{survfit}.
    \describe{
      \item{se.fit}{
	a logical value indicating whether standard errors should be 
	computed.  Default is \code{TRUE}. For a multistate model, where
	the infinitesimal jackknife (robust) standar error is used, the
	compute time for the standard error is O(ndp) where n = number of
	observations, d = number of events and p = number of states,
	while that for all other portions of the output
	(\code{pstate}, \code{cumhaz} and counts) is O((n+d)p).
	For a moderate to large data set the compute time difference
	between nd and n+d can be huge; using \code{se.fit = FALSE} may
	be a wise choice.
      }
      \item{conf.type}{
	One of \code{"none"}, \code{"plain"}, \code{"log"} (the default),
	\code{"log-log"}, \code{"logit"} or \code{"arcsin"}.  Only
	enough of the string to uniquely identify it is necessary.
	The first option causes confidence intervals not to be
	generated.  The second causes the standard intervals
	\code{curve +- k *se(curve)}, where k is determined from
	\code{conf.int}.  The log option calculates intervals based on the
	cumulative hazard or log(survival). The log-log option bases the
	intervals on the log hazard or log(-log(survival)), the
	logit option on log(survival/(1-survival))
	and arcsin on arcsin(survival). 
      }
      \item{conf.lower}{
	a character string to specify modified lower limits to the curve, the 
	upper limit remains unchanged.  
	Possible values are \code{"usual"} (unmodified), 
	\code{"peto"}, 
	and \code{"modified"}.  The modified lower limit 
	is based on an "effective n" argument.  The confidence 
	bands will agree with the usual calculation at each death time, but unlike 
	the usual bands the confidence interval becomes wider at each censored 
	observation.  The extra width is obtained by multiplying the usual 
	variance by a factor m/n, where n is the number currently at risk and 
	m is the number at risk at the last death time.  (The bands thus agree 
	with the un-modified bands at each death time.) 
	This is especially useful for survival curves with a long flat tail. 
	
	The Peto lower limit is based on the same "effective n" argument as the 
	modified limit, but also replaces the usual Greenwood variance term with 
	a simple approximation.  It is known to be conservative. 
      }
      \item{start.time}{
	numeric value specifying a time to start calculating survival
	information.
	The resulting curve is the survival conditional on surviving to
	\code{start.time}.
      }
      \item{conf.int}{
	the level for a two-sided confidence interval on the survival curve(s). 
	Default is 0.95. 
      }
      \item{influence}{a logical value indicating whether to return the
	infinitesimal jackknife (influence) values for each subject.
	See details below.
     }

      \item{p0}{this applies only to multi-state curves. 
	An optional vector giving the initial probability across
	the states. If this is missing, then p0 is estimated using the
	frequency of the starting states of all observations at risk
	at \code{start.time}, or if that is not specified, at
	the time of the first event.}
      \item{entry}{by default, the survfit routines only return
	information at the event/censoring times. If \code{entry=TRUE} then
	also return a \code{n.enter} component containing the number
	who joined the risk set at each time; if necessary add extra
	rows to the output for each unique entry time. 
	This is only applicable for (time1, time2) survival data, and
	if there is an \code{id} statement.  If a single subject had
	times of (0,10), (10, 20), (25,30) with an event at 30,
	then time 10 is not an entry or censoring time,
	but 20 counts as censored and 25 as an entry. 
      }
	
      \item{type}{an older argument that combined \code{stype} and
	\code{ctype}, now deprecated.  Legal values were "kaplan-meier"
	which is equivalent to \code{stype=1, ctype=1}, "fleming-harrington"
	which is equivalent to \code{stype=2, ctype=1}, and "fh2" which
	is equivalent to \code{stype=2, ctype=2.}

\details{
  If there is a \code{data} argument, then variables in the \code{formula},
  \code{weights}, \code{subset}, \code{id}, \code{cluster} and
  \code{istate} arguments will be searched for in that data set.

  The routine returns both an estimated probability in state and an
  estimated cumulative hazard estimate.
  For simple survival the probability in state = probability alive, i.e,
  the estimated survival. For multi-state it will be a matrix with one
  row per time and a column per state, rows sum to 1.
  The cumulative hazard estimate is the Nelson-Aalen (NA) estimate or the
  Fleming-Harrington (FH) estimate, the latter includes a correction for
  tied event times.  The estimated probability in state can estimated
  either using the exponential of the cumulative hazard, or as a direct
  estimate using the Aalen-Johansen approach.
  For single state data the AJ estimate reduces to the Kaplan-Meier and
  the probability in state to the survival curve; 
  for competing risks data the AJ reduces to the cumulative incidence (CI)
  estimator.
  For backward compatability the \code{type} argument can be used instead.
  
  When the data set includes left censored or interval censored data (or both),
  then the EM approach of Turnbull is used to compute the overall curve.
  Currently this algorithm is very slow, only applies to simple survival
  (not multi-state), and defaults to a robust variance.  Other R
  packages are available which implement the iterative convex minorant
  (ICM) algorithm for
  interval censored data, which is much faster than Turnbull's method.
  Based on Sun (2001) the robust variance may be preferred, as the naive estimate
  ignores the estimation of the weights.  The standard estimate can be
  obtained with \code{robust= FALSE}.
 
  Without interval or left censored data (the usual case) the
  underlying algorithm for the routine is the Aalen-Johansen
  estimate, of which the Kaplan-Meier (for single outcome data) and the
  cumulative incidence (CI) estimate (for competing risks) are each a special
  case. For multi-state, the estimate can be written as
  \eqn{p(t_0)H(t_1)H(t_2)\ldots}{p(t0)H(t1)H(t2)...} where \eqn{p(t_0)}{p(t0)}
  is the prevalance vector across the states at starting
  point \eqn{t_0}{t0}, \eqn{t_1, t_2, \ldots}{t1, t2, ...} are the
  times at which events (transitions between states) occur, and H are
  square transtion matrices with a row for each state.

  Starting point: When diffent subjects (\code{id}) start at different
  time points, data using age as the time scale for instance,
  deciding the default "time 0" can be complex.  This value is the
  starting point for the restricted mean estimate (area under the
  curve), the initial prevalence p0, and the first
  row of output if \code{time0 = TRUE}.  The order of the decision is
  \enumerate{
    \item For a 2 column response (simple survival or competing risks)
    use the minimum of 0 and the smallest time value (times can be
    negative).
    \item If all subjects start in the same state, start at the same time,
    or if \code{p0} is specified, use the minimum observed starting
    time.  If there is no \code{istate} argument all observations are
    assumed to start in a state "(s0)".
    \item Use the minimum observed event time, if the number at risk at
     that time is >0 for every curve that will be created.
    \item Use the minimum event time for each curve, separately.
    }
  The last two above are a failsafe to prevent the routine from basing
  the initial prevalence of the states on none or only a handful of
  observations.   That does not mean such curves
  will be scientfically sensible: when using age scale the user may wish
  to specify an explicit starting time.
  If \code{time0 = TRUE} the first row of output for each curve will be
  at the starting time, 
  otherwise the first event time (for each curve separately).
    
  Robust variance:
  If a \code{robust} is TRUE, or for multi-state
  curves, then the standard
  errors of the results will be based on an infinitesimal jackknife (IJ)
  estimate, otherwise the standard model based estimate will be used.
  For single state curves, the default for \code{robust} will be TRUE 
  if one of: there is a \code{cluster} argument, there
  are non-integer weights, or there is a \code{id} statement
  and at least one of the id values has multiple events, and FALSE otherwise.
  The default represents our best guess about when one would most
  often desire a robust variance.
  When there are non-integer case weights and (time1, time2) survival
  data the routine is at an impasse: a robust variance likely is called
  for, but requires either \code{id} or \code{cluster} information to be
  done correctly; it will default to robust=FALSE if they are not present.

  With the IJ estimate, the leverage values themselves can be returned
  as an array using the \code{influence} argument.
  Be forwarned that this array can be huge. Post fit influence using the
  \code{resid} method is more flexible and would normally be preferred,
  in particular to get influence at only a select set of time points.
  The \code{influence} option is currently used mostly in the package's
  validity checks.

  Let \eqn{U(t)}{U(t)} be the matrix of IJ values at time t, which has
  one row per observation, one column per state. The robust variance
  compuation uses the collapsed weighted matrix
  \code{rowsum(wU, cluster)},
  where w is the vector of weights and cluster is the grouping (most often
  the id). The result for each curve is an array with dimensions
  (number of clusters, number of states, number of times), or a matrix
  for single state data.  When there are multiple curves, the
  influence is a list with one element per curve.
