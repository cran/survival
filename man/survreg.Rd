\title{
  Regression for a Parametric Survival Model 
}
\description{
Fit a parametric survival regression model.
These are location-scale models for an arbitrary transform of the time
variable; the most common cases use a log transformation, leading to
accelerated failure time models.
}
\usage{
survreg(formula, data, weights, subset, 
        na.action, dist="weibull", init=NULL, scale=0, 
        control,parms=NULL,model=FALSE, x=FALSE,
        y=TRUE, robust=FALSE, cluster, score=FALSE, \dots)

}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{
a formula expression as for other regression models. 
The response is usually a survival object as returned by the \code{Surv} function. 
See the documentation for \code{Surv}, \code{lm} and \code{formula} for details. 
}
\item{data}{
a data frame in which to interpret the variables named in 
the \code{formula}, \code{weights} or the \code{subset} arguments. 
}
\item{weights}{optional vector of case weights}
\item{subset}{
  subset of the observations to be used in the fit
}
\item{na.action}{
a missing-data filter function, applied to the model.frame, after any 
\code{subset} argument has been used.  Default is \code{options()\$na.action}. 
}
\item{dist}{
assumed distribution for y variable. 
If the argument is a character string, then it is assumed to name an
element from \code{\link{survreg.distributions}}. These include
\code{"weibull"}, \code{"exponential"}, \code{"gaussian"},
\code{"logistic"},\code{"lognormal"} and \code{"loglogistic"}.
Otherwise, it is assumed to be a user defined list conforming to the
format described in \code{\link{survreg.distributions}}.
}
\item{parms}{
a list of fixed parameters.  For the t-distribution for instance this is
the degrees of freedom; most of the distributions have no parameters.
}
\item{init}{
optional vector of initial values for the parameters.
}
\item{scale}{
optional fixed value for the scale.  If set to <=0 then the scale is
estimated.
}
\item{control}{
a list of control values, in the format produced by
\code{\link{survreg.control}}. The default value is \code{survreg.control()}
}
\item{model,x,y}{
flags to control what is returned.  If any of these is true, then the
model frame, the model matrix, and/or the vector of response times will be
returned as components of the final result, with the same names as the
flag arguments.}
\item{score}{return the score vector. (This is expected to be zero upon
successful convergence.)
}
\item{robust}{Use robust sandwich error instead of the asymptotic
  formula.  Defaults to TRUE if there is a \code{cluster} argument.}
\item{cluster}{Optional variable that identifies groups of subjects,
  used in computing the robust variance.  Like \code{model} variables,
  this is searched for in the dataset pointed to by the \code{data}
  argument.
}  
\item{\dots}{
other arguments which will be passed to \code{survreg.control}.
}}
\value{
an object of class \code{survreg} is returned.
}
\details{
  All the distributions are cast into a location-scale framework, based
  on chapter 2.2 of Kalbfleisch and Prentice.  The resulting
  parameterization of the distributions is sometimes (e.g. gaussian)
  identical to the usual form found in statistics textbooks, but other
  times (e.g. Weibull) it is not.  See the book for detailed formulas.

  When using weights be aware of the difference between replication
  weights and sampling weights.  In the former, a weight of '2' means
  that there are two identical observations, which have been combined
  into a single row of data.  With sampling weights there is a single
  observed value, with a weight used to achieve balance with respect to
  some population.  To get proper variance with replication weights use
  the default variance, for sampling weights use the robust variance.
  Replication weights were once common (when computer memory was much
  smaller) but are now rare.

# There are multiple ways to parameterize a Weibull distribution. The survreg 
# function embeds it in a general location-scale family, which is a 
# different parameterization than the rweibull function, and often leads
# to confusion.
#   survreg's scale  =    1/(rweibull shape)
#   survreg's intercept = log(rweibull scale)
#   For the log-likelihood all parameterizations lead to the same value.
y <- rweibull(1000, shape=2, scale=5)
survreg(Surv(y)~1, dist="weibull")

# Economists fit a model called `tobit regression', which is a standard
# linear regression with Gaussian errors, and left censored data.
