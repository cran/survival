    ** The heart of the algorithm is to think of the ordered list of
    **   unique values as a balanced binary tree.  (Credit to Brad Broom
    **   of Rice U for this idea).
    **  For any node k, below it to the left all values are < x2[k],
    **    and below to the right all values are > x2[k].  (Draw a picture).
    **  The root of the tree is element k= floor((n2-1)/2), with value x2[k].
    **  In general, for any subtree that "owns" elements i to j, the root
    **    of that subtree is element k= floor((i+j)/2), whose left subtree
    **    owns elements i to k-1 of the tree, and right subtree owns elements
    **    k+1 to j.
    **     
    **  As we update, count[i] will be the number of data values in this
    **     node and all nodes below.
    **
    **  We walk through the data one survival time at at time, comparing each
    **    to all the survival times above it.
    **  If the time is censored, all those above are "incomparable".
    **  Otherwise, we need to find the position of x[i], among x[1: (i-1)]
    **  We do this by updating the counts in the binary tree.  The count
    **  vector contains the number of x[0 to i] that are in or below any
    **  given node k of the binary tree.
    ** 
    **  Tied death times are a nuisance; we have to refrain from updating
    **   the counts until the end of each set of them.  Thus a vector
    **   count1 (up to date) and count2 (lagged).
