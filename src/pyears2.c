/*
**  Person-years calculations.
**     same as pyears1, but no expected rates
**
**  Input:
**      n       number of subjects
**      ny      number of columns of y.
**      doevent does y have an 'events' column?  1=yes, 0=no
**              if ny=2 and doevent=1, then "start" is missing.
**      y[3,n]  contains start, stop, and event for each subject
**      wt      contains the case weights
**
**  output table's description
**      odim        number of dimensions
**      ofac[odim]  1=is a factor, 0=continuous (time based)
**      odims[odim] the number of rows, columns, etc
**      ocut[]      for each non-factor dimension, the odim[i]+1 cutpoints
**                        that define the intervals; concatonated.
**      odata[odim, n]  the subject data-- where each indexes into the
**                        expected table, at time 0.
**
** Output:
**      pyears     output table of person years
**      pn         number of observations that contribute to each cell
**      pcount     number of events
**      offtable   total person years that did not fall into the output table
**
** Scratch     allocated on the fly
**      scratch[edim]
