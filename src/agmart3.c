/*
** The fastest possible calculation (at least the fastest I've come up with)
** for martingale residuals from a (start, stop] model.  
**
** Input
**      nused   the number on which to compute a residual
**      surv    start, stop, event matrix of survival data
**      score   the vector of subject scores, i.e., exp(beta*z)
**      weight  case weights
**      strata  integer vector of strata identifiers
**      sort     sort order for the obs: col1 = stop times, 2 = start times
**         time within strata for both
**      method  will be ==1 for the Efron method
** Output
**      martingale residual
** 
** If an observation is never at risk, e.g. (50, 72] and there are no events
**   in that window, then ensure that we never add/subtract that obs from
**   any totals.  Sometimes users "dice" a data set into a lot of small
**   intervals, and this step helps preserve numeric accuracy if said obs were
**   to have a huge risk score (it happens).  Such obs have a residual of 0.
**   The parent routine will have sorted these to the end of the data, and set
**   nused < nr. The routine below allocated space for the residual
**   (nr= nrow(surv2)) but never uses the obs.

    **  'time' is a scratch variable holding the time of current interest
    **  'person1' walks through the start times.  It will be smaller than 
    **    'person2': if person2=27 that means that 27 subjects have stop >=time,
    **    and are thus potential members of the risk set.  If 'person1' =9,
    **    that means that 9 subjects have start >=time and thus are NOT part
    **    of the risk set.  (stop > start for each subject guarrantees that
    **    the 9 are a subset of the 27). 
    **  A basic rule is to remove subjects from the sums as soon as possible
    **    and add them as late as possible: (a-b) +c vs (a+c)-b when b might
    **    be large.
    **  Algorithm: 
    **    look ahead to find the next death time 'dtime'
    **    remove anyone no longer at risk from the sums, finish calculating resid
    **    add anyone newly at risk to the sums
    **    update the cumulative hazard
    **    everything resets at the end of a stratum.
    **  The sort order is from large time to small, so we encounter a subject's
    **    ending time first, then their start time.
    **  The martingale residual for a subject is 
    **     status - (cumhaz at tstop - cumhaz at tstart+0)*score
    **  If there is an observation that is never in a risk set, i.e., the
    **   (time1, time2) pair overlaps no events, the parent routine will have
    **   sorted them to the end, set nused < nr, and their initial residual
    **   of zero never is updated.
